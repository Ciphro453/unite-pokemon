While the shield persists, Aegislash is Unstoppable and incoming damage increases boost count by 1 for each different source (capping at 2). When this move ends, shove enemies for .75s in front of Aegislash once again and slow them by 45% for 2s.\r\n\r\nGain 1 boosted count if the shove at the end hits at least one enemy. If the great shield is depleted before the duration of this move ends, the boosted count is granted regardless of whether an enemy is hit.",

When the ally Pokémon this Pokémon is attached to gains more Aeos energy than the maximum it can hold, Comfey takes the excess. When the ally Pokémon this Pokémon is attached to scores a goal, Comfey also scores with the same amount of energy. If Comfey uses a Move during the scoring charge up, Comfey's portion of the score will be cancelled. Comfey may Release from an ally Pokémon, then moves in the designated direction. If the ally Pokémon attached to was being granted a shield via Triage, the Triage portion of the shield is removed. After this Pokémon releases, its next basic attack becomes a boosted basic attack. Release direction is controlled by Right Stick on Switch and uses the D-Pad's down button on Switch or an individual button for Mobile.",

If the user hits enemies four times with either Feint Attack or other moves without interrupting the chain of marking, the next use of Feint Attack changes.
